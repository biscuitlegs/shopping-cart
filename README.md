# Shopping Cart

This is a React app that has a fake shop where you can add items to a fake basket.
Clicking the checkout button in the basket won't do anything because it's not a real shop!

## Project Goals

- Create a shop where the user can browse items and add them to a basket, where they can adjust the quantities of the items, or just remove them.
- Use [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) to allow navigation between a home page and a shop page.
- Use the [testing library](https://testing-library.com/) to implement React tests.
